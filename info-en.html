    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="info-title">Services and what you get out of them</h2>
      
      <div class="info-text">
        <p><strong>NIE - Foreigner Identification Number (€120)</strong><br>
        Without the NIE it is impossible to open a bank account, sign a lease or apply for residencia. This is the first step for any foreigner in Spain. We help you choose the right basis, prepare the forms, pay the fees and get the NIE without mistakes. At the end - NIE and a step-by-step plan of your next steps.</p>

        <p><strong>Residencia - legal residence (€250)</strong><br>
        Residencia gives access to medicine, education, formal employment and business. A mistake at this stage leads to rejection and reapplication. We select the right basis, prepare documents, translate and accompany you to the result. The result - legal status in Spain and a checklist for future steps.</p>

        <p><strong>FNMT digital signature (€90)</strong><br>
        A digital signature is the key to dealing with tax, social services, fines and subsidies online. We issue and install the certificate on your phone or PC, back it up and train you how to use it.</p>

        <p><strong>Autónomo - self-employment registration (€200)</strong><br>
        Autónomo is an opportunity to bill legally, connect Tarifa Plana (~€80/month) and access business services. We choose the right IAE code, issue alta en RETA and connect the contributions. If desired, we take over the quarterly reporting.</p>

        <p><strong>Translations and meetings (from €50)</strong><br>
        In Spain, precise wording is important. We provide interpretation and translation, accompany you to meetings and record agreements. Formats: hourly, half-day, daily or remotely.</p>

        <p><strong>Housing - renting/buying and contract verification (€180 - verification)</strong><br>
        Contracts often hide penalties, deductions and unfavorable clausulas. We analyze the lease or purchase agreement, check the parties and costs, amend and negotiate. In addition, we help you find a lease or tenant, assist you with the purchase and advise you on mortgages.</p>

        <p><strong>Social integration (€80)</strong><br>
        To make life on the islands comfortable, you need insurance, a doctor, school or daycare for the kids, and a replacement driver's license. We take all these steps with you and also give you household checklists: how to connect the internet, utilities and where to get insurance.</p>

        <p><strong>VIP 24/7 (from €500/month)</strong><br>
        Personalized client management is a personal assistant who is there for you at all times. We take on the role of "personal guide" in Spain: priority appointments, quick answers, accompaniment everywhere and at all times. You get a person who knows all your questions and solves them instead of you. This is the choice of clients who value their time and want life in the Canaries to be easy and convenient.</p>

      <div class="info-text">
        <p><strong>Family with children</strong><br>
        Step-by-step support: registration of NIE → residencia → enrollment of children in school and pediatrician → renting an apartment with verification of the contract. In addition, we helped to connect medical insurance and internet. The result - the family finalized all the documents in 2 months and started life without bureaucratic problems.</p>

        <p><strong>Entrepreneur</strong><br>
        First we got a FNMT to work with the tax office, then the autónomo registration. After that, they opened a bank account, set up Tarifa Plana and connected the accounting system. Within the first month, the entrepreneur signed his first contracts and fully legalized the business.</p>

        <p><strong>Buying an apartment</strong><br>
        Verification of the object and the sales contract → negotiations with the seller → support at the notary → registration of ownership. The client avoided hidden tax expenses and obtained a mortgage on favorable terms.</p>

        <p><strong>Find and rent accommodation</strong><br>
        The client had just arrived on the island and did not know where to look for a rental. We selected several options, checked the contracts, negotiated a reduced deposit and eliminated the risks. As a result, the client moved in within 5 days in a checked apartment.</p>

        <p><strong>Agree on all the nuances</strong><br>
        Support at the bank and at the notary: we translated all the terms and conditions and fixed the agreements. The client was sure that he was signing exactly what had been agreed. The result - no "hidden cláusulas"</p>

        <p><strong>Account opening and insurance</strong><br>
        A foreigner faced rejection from a bank because of missing documents. We prepared a full package, found a suitable bank and set up an account. At the same time, we arranged medical insurance, which was immediately suitable for the residencia.</p>

        <p><strong>Change of driver's license</strong><br>
        The client arrived with a non-EU license. We helped to collect the documents, translate them, made an appointment for the exam and exchange. After 1.5 months, the client received his Spanish license without fines and restrictions.</p>

        <p><strong>Social integration</strong><br>
        Assistance in enrolling a child in kindergarten, arranging insurance, connecting to a doctor, household checklists: where to buy furniture, how to connect water and electricity. The client received a ready adaptation plan and stopped "getting lost" in the new environment.</p>

        <p><strong>Complex relocation</strong><br>
        The family was planning to relocate from Germany. We prepared the NIE, registered residencia, checked and agreed the rent, opened bank accounts, enrolled the children in school. In the end, the whole process took 3 months, with no rejections or resubmissions.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="info-title">FAQ — Frequent questions from foreigners in the Canaries</h2>
      
      <div class="info-text">
        <p><strong>Why not do it all yourself?</strong><br>
        You can, but the price of mistakes is months of waiting, repeated collections and wasted time. We prepare the package correctly the first time and accompany you on key visits.</p>

        <p><strong>Are you "speeding up" the processes?</strong><br>
        No. We don't sell "queue bypass." We prepare the correct package, monitor slots and save you visits. Everything is strictly within the law.</p>

        <p><strong>How long does it take to process a residencia?</strong><br>
        Depends on the basis: for EU citizens, from a few weeks, for non-EU citizens, longer. We immediately give a realistic range and prepare a plan B.</p>

        <p><strong>Can everything be done remotely?</strong><br>
        Some of it yes: FNMT, forms, records. But key visits (police, notary, bank) require personal presence. We accompany you in person.</p>

        <p><strong>Do I need to know Spanish?</strong><br>
        No, but it makes life a lot easier. We translate and accompany to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings.</p>

        <p><strong>What is empadronamiento?</strong><br>
        It is a residence registration at the City Hall. Without it, you cannot register for a residencia, get a doctor's appointment or enroll your children in school.</p>

        <p><strong>Is it possible to open a bank account without NIE?</strong><br>
        No. You need an NIE for any account or mortgage. That's why it's the first document we process.</p>

        <p><strong>How much does health insurance cost?</strong><br>
        Private insurance for residencia usually costs €40-80 per month. We will find an option that will be accepted by the authority.</p>

        <p><strong>Do I need to change my driver's license?</strong><br>
        If you are from the EU - you can drive with your own, but we recommend exchanging it for a Spanish one. If you are not from the EU - you must exchange them after 6 months.</p>

        <p><strong>How long does it take to register autónomo?</strong><br>
        Usually 1-2 days. The main thing is to choose the right activity code (IAE). We do everything on a turnkey basis.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I apply for residencia without a lease or ownership agreement?</strong><br>
        No. You need proof of residency. We check contracts and help you find the right one.</p>

        <p><strong>What should I do if I lost my FNMT digital signature?</strong><br>
        Re-issue. We always make a backup to avoid this.</p>

        <p><strong>What are the risks of an error in a lease or purchase agreement?</strong><br>
        Financial losses: deposit withholding, fines, additional costs. We check and adjust all cláusulas.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I work without residencia?</strong><br>
        No. You need residencia for official work or business. Otherwise there are fines and risk of deportation.</p>

        <p><strong>What do you do if the next cita is only a few months away?</strong><br>
        We monitor the system and "catch" free slots. We also offer alternative agencies if this speeds up the process</p>

        <p><strong>Is it possible to buy a house without NIE and residencia at once?</strong><br>
        No. NIE is required for the transaction at the notary. We formalize everything step by step so that the purchase is done correctly.</p>

        <p><strong>How much does it cost for a child to go to school or daycare?</strong><br>
        Public ones are free, but you need residencia and empadronamiento. Private ones start at €250 a month. We help with registration and documents.</p>

        <p><strong>What is included in social inclusion?</strong><br>
        Health insurance, doctor's attachment, license exchange, enrollment of children in school/kindergarten. These are the basic comforts of life.</p>

        <p><strong>What are the minimum steps needed to get your life started?</strong><br>
        NIE, residencia, bank account, insurance and empadronamiento. Everything else is built on this basis.</p>

        <p><strong>Can I translate the documents myself?</strong><br>
        Formally, yes, but often agencies do not accept "free translations". We work with recognized translations that are accepted officially.</p>

        <p><strong>Do you help with rental housing?</strong><br>
        Yes: we check the contract, make amendments, explain cláusulas, negotiate. We can also find a lease or tenant on request.</p>

        <p><strong>How is payment for services handled?</strong><br>
        Under contract. Prepayment of 30-50% to start recordings and translations. Final payment - after the service is rendered.</p>

        <p><strong>Can a mortgage be arranged for a foreigner?</strong><br>
        Yes, but the process is complicated: you need NIE, income and confirmations. We advise, check the bank and prepare the package.</p>

        <p><strong>What do you do if the rules change?</strong><br>
        It's Spain 🙂 It happens. We promptly rearrange the plan and file under the new requirements.</p>
